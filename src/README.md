# Source Code

This is the main source directory for the Angular application.

## Structure

- `app/` - Main application code
- `assets/` - Application assets (images, styles, etc.)
- `environments/` - Environment-specific configuration files

## Build Process

All TypeScript files in this directory are compiled and bundled during the build process. The build output is served to the browser.

## Development

When making changes to files in this directory, the development server will automatically reload the application (hot module replacement).
